# Human Resource

Data entities for a human resource system.
We come from the perspective of an organisation administrator.

## Stories

The purpose of the HR administrator is to manage human resource of an organisation.

Hence, when a new user **first log on** to the system, user must define the organisation 
that they would like to manage.

User can manage many organisations.
So we need to allow them to define multiple organisations.

If there are multiple users managing the human resource of an organisation, 
the creator of the organisation can add other users as administrators of the organisation
that they have created.

TO_THINK: How to manage administrators leaving the organisation?
