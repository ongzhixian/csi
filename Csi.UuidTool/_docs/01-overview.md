# Overview

UUID tool

## Usage

uuid ms
uuid 1
uuid 2
uuid 3
uuid 4
uuid 5
uuid 0


## Types

For both variants 1 and 2, five "versions" are defined in the standards, and each version may be more appropriate than the others in specific use cases. Version is indicated by the M in the string representation.

Version-1 UUIDs are generated from a time and a node id (usually the MAC address); 
Version-2 UUIDs are generated from an identifier (usually a group or user id), time, and a node id; 
Version-4 UUIDs are generated using a random or pseudo-random number.
Versions 3 produce deterministic UUIDs generated by hashing (MD5) a namespace identifier and name; and 
Versions 5 produce deterministic UUIDs generated by hashing (SHA1) a namespace identifier and name; and 
The "nil" UUID, a special case, is the UUID 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
